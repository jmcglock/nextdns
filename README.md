# NextDNS Allowlist and Blocklist
This repository contains my personal allowlist and blocklist for NextDNS, a cloud-based DNS provider that offers ad-blocking, malware protection, and content filtering.

## Usage
To use my allowlist and blocklist, you can simply add each domain to your NextDNS account allowlist/denylist.

## Contributing
If you find any domains that should be added to either the allowlist or blocklist, feel free to create a pull request with your changes.
